%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
This report explains and analyzes the system developed by Team FADERIC for the LongEval Lab at CLEF 2023, Task 1 - LongEval-Retrieval. The team members are all students following the Search Engines course a.y. 2022/23 at the Computer Engineering master degree at University of Padua. The system developed is a search engine that has to retrieve documents from a corpus, composed of original files in French language and automatically translated files in English language. The produced IR system exploits the query expansion technique, such as word N-grams and synonyms, and also the use of a reranking to improve the overall performance. Evaluating the longitudinal effectiveness of the system using the multiple collections provided by CLEF, we show that the performances remain satisfactory over time.
