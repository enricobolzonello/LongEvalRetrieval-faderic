\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Search engines have become an indispensable tool for people to retrieve various kinds of information in their daily 
routine. However, recent research has shown that \ac{IR} systems tend to perform poorly over time as the test data becomes more distant from the training data. This issue is particularly critical in the field of computer science, where data is constantly updated and information quickly becomes obsolete. Therefore, \ac{CLEF} 2023 LongEval task \cite{longevaloverview2023} has gained interest in evaluating the temporal persistence of \ac{IR} systems. The aim of this report is to present the solution of Team FADERIC to this challenge. The team members are all students following the Search Engines course a.y. 2022/23 at the Computer Engineering master degree at University of Padua. \\The paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:related} shows the related work we have started from; Section~\ref{sec:methodology} describes our approach; Section~\ref{sec:setup} explains our experimental setup; Section~\ref{sec:results} discusses our main findings; finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} draws some conclusions and outlooks for future work.
