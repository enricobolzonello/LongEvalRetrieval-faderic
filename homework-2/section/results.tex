In this Section we will show and analyze the results obtained by our system.
In particular, Section~\ref{subsec:train-res} will be about the results of all the runs produced by our system on the training collection during its development, while Section~\ref{subsec:test-res} will consist of a statistical analysis of the runs submitted to \ac{CLEF} on the test collections.
