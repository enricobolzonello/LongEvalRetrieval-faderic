\subsection{Searcher}
\label{subsec:searcher}

In the searcher we have used a \emph{boolean query} approach, in this way it was possible to create complex queries by combining, using the \emph{boolean operators}, different components to be matched. The components we have used in our queries are explained from Section~\ref{subsubsec:bm25} to Section~\ref{subsubsec:reranker}. Note that in the following, the word N-grams component explained in Section~\ref{subsubsec:shingles} will be referenced also with the Lucene's jargon \emph{shingles}.
