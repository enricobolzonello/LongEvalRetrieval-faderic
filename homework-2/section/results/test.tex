\subsection{Test results}
\label{subsec:test-res}

In this Section, we will analyze the performance of the submitted runs on heldout, short term and long term collections. At first, we will tackle the performance changes and then we will perform a \emph{statistical analysis}. In this last part, we will use ANOVA2 with a significance level $\alpha=0.05$ in order to find out if we can reject the \emph{null hypothesis}, i.e. there is no significant statistical difference between the results of the given runs. \\Then we will use Tukey's \ac{HSD} test to perform \emph{multiple} pairwise comparisons and determine which specific run means differ significantly from each other.

Since we have submitted four runs performed on the French collection and one on the English collection, in the statistical analysis we will compare to each other only the French runs.
