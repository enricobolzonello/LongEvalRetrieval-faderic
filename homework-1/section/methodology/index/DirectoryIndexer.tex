indexes the documents located in a specified directory and its sub-directories. It accepts various parameters, including the directory containing the documents to be indexed, the \texttt{DocumentParser}, the \texttt{Analyzer}, the \texttt{Similarity} to be used for indexing, the expected number of documents and the location where the index will be stored. Our code ensures that the document directory is readable and the index directory is writable before initiating the indexing process. Additionally, it keeps track of statistics, such as the number of indexed files and documents. \\
The main component of the class is the \texttt{index} method, which is in charge of performing the actual indexing of the documents. This method iterates through the documents in the directory, extracting their content and adding it to the index. During all the iterations, some statistics indexing is given, such as the time taken every 10 thousand documents. Finally, the index is closed.
