\subsubsection{English analyzer}

The \texttt{EnglishLongEvalAnalyzer} component is in charge of processing English language texts, it is composed by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tokenizing}: the \texttt{StandardTokenizer} is used, which exploits the Word Break rules from Unicode Text Annex \#29 \citep{UAX29};
    \item \textbf{Character folding}: the \texttt{ICUFoldingFilter} is used, which applies the foldings from Unicode Technical Report \#30 \citep{UTR30}. This is useful to fold upper cases, accents and other kinds of complex characters;
    \item \textbf{Possessive removal}: the \texttt{EnglishPossessiveFilter} is used, which removes the very frequent possessives ('s) from words;
    \item \textbf{Stopword removal}: the \texttt{StopFilter} is used, which removes the given stopwords from the tokens. In this system we have tried using the default Lucene \citep{Lucene} stoplist and custom one, generated by picking the 50 most frequent terms in the documents;
    \item \textbf{Position filtering}: a custom \texttt{TokenFilter} has been implemented to set the \texttt{positionIncrement} attribute of all tokens to a specific value. This will be useful to ignore the \texttt{positionIncrement} due to removed stopwords in the search phase when we will use the proximity between tokens, as explained in Subsection~\ref{subsubsec:shingles};
    \item \textbf{Stemming}: this process is useful to reduce words to their base form, in this system we have tried using the Snowball English (Porter2) \citep{EnSnowball} and the Krovetz \citep{Krovetz2000} stemmers.
\end{itemize}

In Table~\ref{tab:english-analyzer} we show an example of the analyzing process for the English language.
