\subsection{Searcher}
\label{subsec:searcher}

In the searcher we have used a \emph{boolean query} approach, in this way it was possible to create complex queries by combining, using the \emph{boolean operators}, different components to be matched. The component we have used in our queries are explained in Subsections from~\ref{subsubsec:bm25} to~\ref{subsubsec:reranker}.
